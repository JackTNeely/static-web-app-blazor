This record exists to provide a health check verification on the path <fqdn>/<filename.ext> for Azure Traffic Manager.

Example:
A Traffic Manager profile is configured to query HTTPS traffic over port 443 with a specified path of "/aztm-dr-verify.txt" and expects a header response code of 200.
If, for a given endpoint domain.com, https://domain.com/aztm-dr-verify.txt does not exists and responds with a status of 404 (file not found), the endpoint will fail the health check performed by Traffic Manager and be automatically marked as "Degraded".
In a Priority routing configuration, this can allow for Traffic Manager to redirect traffic away from the Degraded endpoint toward the next "Online" (available) endpoint.

This allows for more granular troubleshooting by querying a filepath in the web directory as opposed to the root domain. I.e., an endpoint can be forced into a Degraded status by modifying the name of or deleting this file.
Commonly, "/favicon.ico" is used to perform this type of health check.

Note:
In Traffic Manager, health check paths are configured at the Traffic Manager profile level. Paths cannot be specified separately for different endpoints within a Traffic Manager profile.
